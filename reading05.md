Patch Tuesday is every 2nd Tuesday of the month when Microsoft releases large package updates for all supported software. They could come as early as 10 am PST with later hours producing further pushes.

“Out-of-band” updates are essential updates--to security flaws as an example--pushed out to keep user systems secure.

As Patch Tuesday is the “B” release, there is space to optionally add further releases in subsequent weeks, as “C” and “D” releases and appear as “optional updates in Windows 10.”

This has set somewhat of an industry standard as companies realize this makes it easier on administrators to have updates be regular and anticipatory.

Patch Tuesday is NOT major updates to the OS at-large; those come out whenever they need to do so; interestingly, you may “update,” when released, but MS may not activate it for months, using AI to determine its safety for actual deployment!
