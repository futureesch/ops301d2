NGINX is open source software “for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more”

Solving the 1999 problem known as C10K whereby more than 9,999 concurrent connections to a web server became difficult for the server. Since the web was growing then, this situation required a solution. 

Made open source in 2004 and combined with a paid-tier called NGINX Plus with additional features for enterprise customers.

They argue they’ve kept pace with the development of the web, enabling their servers to provide the latest in web UX. 

Some other features: 
Reverse proxy and load balancer
Second server SSL/TLS terminator or web accelerator
Makes the most effective use of “hardware” and consistent with its claim to stay current, it seems to nod towards virtualization services

By containing so many full stack tools all in one place, NGINX really powers scalability for users at the open source and enterprise levels. 

Of note is that Netflix uses their architecture.
